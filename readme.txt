Natty Parks is a website that uses the NPS API to display information about the parks stored in the database.

The functionality is selecting the desired state which will accumulate the National Parks within that state. It's also populating historic sites, monuments, etc ontop of parks.

If you do not have a state in mind, you can click the "EXPLORE" button and it will return a random park within the database and display it.

On the front of the cards there are several images that have a carousel function that will rotate through the images in the API every 3 seconds.

The cards displayed flip when you hover over the card. It displays limited information on the back of the card along with the website if you are more than interested in the selected park.
